# BattleBoa
A game built from the ground up using Python and the Pygame library. It was my personal challenge to dive deep into Python and explore what I could create while growing my skills. 
🎲 Keeping It Simple: no fancy UI or complex player options, just pure, straightforward gameplay.
🚀 Future Possibilities: Someday, I might revisit this project, maybe in a different language or with a new game engine, adding more bells and whistles. But for now, I'm excited to share this as it is.
🕹️ Time to Play: So go ahead, dive in, and have a blast with my creation. Your feedback and thoughts are always welcome! Happy gaming! 

### Game Play
In BattleBoa, your mission is super simple: gobble up as much food as you can! 🍎
Each time you snag a tasty treat, it teleports to a new spot on the screen - keep your eyes peeled and reflexes ready! 
But wait, there's a twist! 🐍 Watch out for that sneaky computer-controlled snake. A collision with it, and bam! It's game over, and back to square one you go, score and all.

#### Controls

🎮 Player 1 is controlled via the mouse. The snake will follow the user's mouse position while its in the game window.
